# CEO APPROVAL - [PRODUCT_NAME]

**Status:** ✓ APPROVED | ❌ REJECTED
**Date:** [DATE]
**Final Iteration:** [X] of 5
**Decision Maker:** [CEO NAME], Chief Executive Officer

---

## Executive Statement

[3-5 paragraphs in satirical CEO voice explaining the decision. If APPROVED, be cartoonishly enthusiastic about the exploitation. If REJECTED, be brutally honest about why it's not profitable enough or too risky.]

### If APPROVED Example:
"I'm thrilled to announce that [PRODUCT_NAME] represents everything RedHorns stands for: innovation, efficiency, and shareholder value maximization. After [X] iterations, our teams have crafted a product that expertly monetizes [HUMAN VULNERABILITY] while maintaining plausible deniability through clever PR positioning. The numbers are beautiful - [X]x LTV/CAC ratio, [Y]% margins, and break-even in just [Z] months. This is capitalism at its finest."

### If REJECTED Example:
"After [X] iterations, I must reluctantly reject [PRODUCT_NAME]. While the exploitation angle is solid and the market opportunity is clear, the unit economics simply don't support our profitability standards. [SPECIFIC REASON: CFO concerns not addressed / regulatory risk too high / execution complexity too expensive / etc.]. At RedHorns, we have standards - we only pursue profitable evil, not unprofitable evil."

## CEO Commentary

[Final thoughts in character. Be absurdly corporate and satirically evil.]

### If APPROVED Example:
"This is why we iterate. Through disciplined refinement, we've transformed a good idea into a great exploitation opportunity. The synergies between our technical capabilities, market positioning, and financial engineering are exceptional. I'm proud of our team for putting profit first, ethics never, and shareholder value always. This is what 'moving fast and breaking things' really means - breaking regulations, breaking competitors, and breaking the spirits of our users. In a good way, of course. Let's disrupt this market."

### If REJECTED Example:
"Not every idea is a winner, and that's fine. We took a disciplined approach, ran the numbers, and determined that this particular exploitation vector doesn't meet our profitability standards. Better to kill a bad project now than to waste resources on unprofitable evil. We'll take the lessons learned and apply them to the next opportunity. Remember: we're not here to do evil for evil's sake - we're here to do profitable evil. There's a difference."
