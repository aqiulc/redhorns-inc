Product Idea: ClassWork Pro

Core Concept:
Create a business where we teach business courses in schools and colleges, fully sponsored by our company. In exchange, every student is assigned 1 hour of work every day doing simple tasks like data entry, presentations, spell check, and other administrative work. This labor is then sold as a service to businesses at low costs.

Key Opportunity:
- Millions of students in schools and colleges (captive labor pool)
- Frame it as "practical business education" and "real-world experience"
- Students work 1 hour/day doing simple tasks (data entry, presentations, proofreading)
- We aggregate this labor and sell it as cheap business services
- Schools get "free" sponsored courses, we get massive labor force
- Students think they're learning, we're extracting value

Target Market:
- High schools and colleges (supply side - students as labor)
- Small/medium businesses needing cheap administrative work (demand side - buyers)
- Educational institutions wanting free curriculum sponsorship

Revenue Model:
- Sell student labor hours as business services at low cost
- Undercut traditional outsourcing (Upwork, Fiverr, VA services)
- Volume play: thousands of students × 1 hour/day = massive capacity

The Big Question:
How do we turn classrooms into profitable labor pools while making it sound like educational empowerment?
