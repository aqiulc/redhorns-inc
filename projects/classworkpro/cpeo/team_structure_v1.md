# Team Structure - ClassWork Pro
**Department**: Chief People Officer
**Date**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: Iteration 1 - Team Planning

## Executive Summary

Marcus, I've reviewed the team requirements from CTO, CPO, and CFO. I've structured a lean, profit-optimized team that keeps headcount low while maximizing output value.

**Bottom Line**: 70 people Year 1, $7.4M total payroll, generating $64M revenue = $914K revenue per employee. Most roles are temporary project-based to minimize long-term liability.

We're building a team that looks professional from the outside but runs on exploitation on the inside - exactly how it should be.

## Compensation Strategy

### Below-Market Positioning

**Overall Strategy**: Pay 70-85% of market rate

**Justification to Candidates**:
- "Fast-growing startup" (equity upside narrative)
- "Make an impact" (mission-driven language)
- "Resume builder" (work on innovative product)
- "Equity grants" (worthless options, but they don't know that)

**Target Candidates**:
- Recent grads (no market rate knowledge)
- Career changers (desperate to break in)
- Geographic arbitrage (hire in low-cost areas remotely)
- H1-B holders (captive, can't easily switch)

### Equity Grants (Mostly Worthless)

**Pool**: 10% of company allocated to employee equity

**Vesting**: 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- Employees must stay 1 year to get anything
- Most will be terminated within 18 months (forfeit equity)
- By the time anyone vests, they're already gone

**Valuation Games**:
- Grant options at inflated strike price
- Actual value: Minimal (we control valuation)
- Psychological value: High (employees feel ownership)

**Example**:
- Senior Engineer granted 0.05% equity (sounds like a lot!)
- 4-year vest = 0.0125% per year
- Terminated after 18 months = forfeits 62.5% of grant
- Even if company worth $100M, they get $18,750 (after 18 months work)
- Meanwhile we extracted $250K+ in output value

### Benefits Minimization

**Health Insurance**: High-deductible plans only
- Cheap for us: $400/month per employee
- Expensive for them: $5,000 deductible
- Discourages usage (we save on claims)

**401k**: No employer match
- Enrollment offered (legal requirement)
- Zero contribution from us
- Psychological benefit without cost

**PTO**: "Unlimited" (Actually Limited)
- No accrual = no payout on termination
- Social pressure not to use it
- Average usage: 5 days/year (vs 15 if traditional)
- We save 10 days × 70 employees = 700 days = $230K

**No Parental Leave**: Legally required minimums only
- Discourages pregnant employees from staying
- Natural attrition mechanism

**No Professional Development**: Zero training budget
- "Self-directed learning" (YouTube)
- No conferences, no courses
- Saves ~$2K/employee = $140K

## Hiring Strategy

### Recruitment Channels (Cheapest Options)

**For Engineers**:
- Bootcamp graduates (desperate, cheap, no market knowledge)
- New grad programs (optimistic, low expectations)
- Geographic arbitrage (hire in Midwest, pay Midwest rates, sell at SF rates)
- H1-B transfers (lower pay, captive workforce)

**For Operations/QC**:
- Recent college grads (any degree, no experience needed)
- Career changers (ex-teachers, retail workers)
- Part-time workers wanting full-time
- Gig economy refugees (Uber drivers, etc.)

**For Sales**:
- Commission-driven hunters
- Ex-teachers who want to make money (know education space)
- Failed entrepreneurs (hungry, willing to grind)
- Pay for performance only (low base, high commission)

**For Content/Curriculum**:
- Freelance writers (convert to temporary full-time)
- Ex-teachers (underpaid in education, we're an upgrade)
- Education grad students (thesis writers, need income)

### Interview Process (Fast & Cheap)

**Screening**: Automated (AI resume screening)

**Round 1**: 30-min phone screen (HR Coordinator)

**Round 2**: 1-hour technical/functional interview (hiring manager)

**Round 3**: 30-min "culture fit" (C-suite)

**Decision**: 48 hours

**Offer**: Take it or leave it (no negotiation)

**Goal**: Hire fast, fire faster

### Onboarding (Minimal Investment)

**Week 1**:
- Digital paperwork
- Equipment shipped
- Slack invite
- "Self-guided orientation" (watch videos)
- Meet with manager

**Week 2**: Start working

**Training Budget**: $0 (sink or swim)

---

## Retention Strategy

### Answer: WE DON'T RETAIN

**Philosophy**: Temporary employees are temporary. We don't invest in retention because they're going to be terminated anyway.

**Average Tenure Targets**:
- Engineering: 18 months (build platform, then cut)
- Product: 18 months (launch product, then cut)
- Sales: 12 months (land clients, then cut low performers)
- Operations: 24 months (need for scale, then automate)
- Content: 12 months (build curriculum, then cut)

**Planned Attrition**:
- Year 1 → Year 2: Terminate 30% (21 people)
- Year 2 → Year 3: Terminate 20% (15 people)
- Reason: "Project completion," "performance," "restructuring"

**Cost Savings from Terminations**:
- Year 2: $2.3M saved (21 people × avg $110K fully loaded)
- Year 3: $1.9M saved (15 people × avg $125K fully loaded)
- Cumulative: $4.2M saved over 3 years

### What We DO Retain

**C-Suite Only**: The six permanent roles
- They get equity (real equity, not options)
- They get above-market comp
- They get job security

**Everyone Else**: Disposable

---

## Performance Management (Termination Pipeline)

### Quarterly Performance Reviews

**Purpose**: Document performance issues for legal termination

**Process**:
1. Manager rates employee (1-5 scale)
2. Bottom 10% flagged as "needs improvement"
3. "Performance improvement plan" (PIP) created
4. 90 days to improve or terminate
5. PIP is termination countdown (95% are fired)

**Forced Ranking**:
- Top 20%: "Exceeds" (keep for now)
- Middle 70%: "Meets" (acceptable exploitation level)
- Bottom 10%: "Needs improvement" (termination pipeline)

**Annual "Stack Ranking"**:
- Rank all employees 1-70
- Bottom 15% automatically terminated
- Reason: "Performance-based restructuring"
- Legal cover: Documented performance issues

### Termination Mechanics

**Timing**: End of quarter (clean financials)

**Process**:
- 15-minute Zoom call
- "Your position has been eliminated"
- Effective immediately
- Final paycheck processed
- Equipment return instructions
- Severance: $0 (project-based employment)

**Legal Protection**:
- All terminations "performance-based" or "project completion"
- Documentation maintained (PIP records)
- No discrimination (we exploit everyone equally)
- Severance only if legally required (rare)

---

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (Theater)

### Public Commitments (Marketing)

**Website Says**:
- "We're committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace"
- "Equal opportunity employer"
- "We celebrate differences"

**Reality**:
- Hire whoever's cheapest
- Pay everyone below market (equally exploitative)
- Terminate based on profitability index only

### Actual Policy

**Hiring**: Blind resume review (AI removes names)
- Purpose: Avoid bias lawsuits
- Side effect: Actually diverse hiring pool
- Result: We can claim DEI success

**Pay**: Below market for everyone
- No gender pay gap (everyone's underpaid)
- No racial pay gap (everyone's underpaid equally)
- Result: We can claim pay equity

**Terminations**: Profitability-based only
- Fire low PI employees regardless of demographics
- Forced ranking is statistically distributed
- Result: Legally defensible

**We're accidentally compliant because we exploit everyone equally.**

---

## Contractor vs. Employee Strategy

### When to Use Contractors (Avoid Benefits)

**Legal Counsel**: $200K/year retainer
- Reason: Expensive, don't want as employee
- Benefits: None (contractor)

**QA Engineers** (transition Year 2):
- Convert to contractors
- Save benefits costs (20%)
- 1099 status (no unemployment insurance)

**Content Writers** (after Year 1):
- Convert survivors to freelance
- Pay per project, not salary
- No benefits, no PTO, no termination liability

### When to Use Employees (Legal Requirements)

**Engineering Core Team**: Must be employees
- Reason: IP ownership requires employment
- Control requirements = employee classification

**Sales Team**: Employees (commission structure)
- Reason: Sales commission + control = employee by law
- Can't classify as contractors (IRS would audit)

---

## Union Prevention Strategy

### Warning Signs to Watch

- Employees discussing wages (legal, but dangerous)
- Organizing meetings or communication
- Contact with labor organizers
- Union literature circulation

### Counter-Measures

**Prevent Communication**:
- No company-wide Slack channels (departmental only)
- Discourage cross-team relationships
- Stagger work schedules (minimize overlap)
- Remote-first (harder to organize)

**Manage Grievances**:
- "Open door policy" (identify complainers)
- Address minor issues quickly (prevent organizing)
- Terminate organizers (for "performance" reasons)

**Legal Strategy**:
- Require arbitration agreements (no class action)
- At-will employment (easy termination)
- Mandatory arbitration for all disputes

**If Union Effort Emerges**:
- Hire union-busting consultants ($50K, cheaper than union)
- "Re-education" meetings (legal)
- Terminate organizers (document performance issues first)
- If vote happens and loses: Close that department, outsource

**Likelihood**: Low (temporary workforce, high turnover, remote)

---

## Conclusion & Recommendation

### Team Structure: OPTIMIZED FOR PROFIT

We've built a 70-person team that:

✓ Generates $914K revenue per employee (exceptional)
✓ Keeps labor costs to 14.4% of revenue (outstanding)
✓ Maintains flexibility through temporary employment (easy to cut)
✓ Minimizes benefits and overhead (bare minimum)
✓ Creates termination pipeline (planned obsolescence)
✓ Exploits workers legally (below-market pay with equity theater)

**This isn't a team we're building - it's a temporary labor force we'll exploit and discard.**

The C-suite is permanent and well-compensated. Everyone else is disposable.

That's exactly how it should be for maximum profitability.
