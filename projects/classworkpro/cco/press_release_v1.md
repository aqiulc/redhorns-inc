## RedHorns Inc. Launches ClassWork Pro: Revolutionary Platform Connecting Student Learning with Real-World Business Experience

*Innovative work-integrated learning program provides students with practical career skills while delivering affordable workforce solutions to businesses nationwide*

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA - December 12, 2025** - RedHorns Incorporated today announced the launch of ClassWork Pro, a groundbreaking educational technology platform that bridges the critical gap between classroom learning and professional career readiness. By partnering with forward-thinking educational institutions, ClassWork Pro creates authentic experiential learning opportunities for students while simultaneously providing businesses with access to reliable, cost-effective administrative support.

### Solving the Experience Gap Crisis

Today's students face an impossible paradox: entry-level jobs require years of experience, but gaining that experience while in school is nearly inaccessible. Traditional internships are highly competitive, geographically limited, and often unpaid. Meanwhile, businesses struggle with the administrative burden of tasks that don't justify full-time hires but are essential to operations.

ClassWork Pro solves both problems simultaneously through innovative work-integrated learning.

"We've created a platform that recognizes a fundamental truth: students learn best by doing, not just studying," said Marcus T. Redhorn, CEO of RedHorns Incorporated. "ClassWork Pro transforms the educational experience by giving every student access to practical, real-world business experience while they're still in school. It's not about replacing traditional education - it's about enhancing it with authentic professional practice."

### How ClassWork Pro Works

**For Students:** ClassWork Pro is integrated as a course offering at partner educational institutions. Students enrolled in the program complete one hour of practical business work daily as part of their curriculum. Tasks include data entry, document review, presentation creation, research, and administrative projects - all real work for real companies. Students receive course credit, professional development tracking, resume credentials, and comprehensive performance analytics.

**For Educational Institutions:** Schools receive premium business curriculum at no cost, complete with lesson plans, teaching resources, and turnkey implementation. The program delivers measurable career readiness outcomes for accreditation while requiring minimal faculty resources.

**For Businesses:** Companies access a supervised, quality-controlled student workforce for administrative tasks at affordable rates. ClassWork Pro handles all recruitment, training, quality assurance, and project management - businesses simply submit tasks and receive professional-quality deliverables with guaranteed turnarounds.

### Preparing Students for Professional Success

ClassWork Pro includes a comprehensive "Success Recovery Framework" designed to develop professional accountability and work ethic:

"In the real workplace, consistency and reliability matter," explains Jennifer Park, Chief Product Officer. "Our Success Recovery Program teaches students that missing work commitments has consequences and that makeup work is expected - just like in professional environments. We're preparing students for workplace expectations in a supportive educational context where they can learn these crucial soft skills."

Students who miss their daily work hour receive Success Recovery assignments to ensure they complete equivalent learning experiences and develop the professional habits essential for career success.

### Unprecedented Market Validation

ClassWork Pro launches with partnerships across 10 pilot educational institutions, serving 2,500 students and supporting 100 small businesses. Early results demonstrate remarkable engagement:

- **92% daily student participation rate**
- **88% business client satisfaction scores**
- **95% student course completion rate**
- **4.6/5 average student rating**

"The response has been extraordinary," said Dr. Tanya Chen, Chief Technology Officer. "We built a platform that students actually want to use. The gamification, social features, and tangible career benefits create genuine engagement. Students see the value immediately - real companies, real work, real experience for their resumes."

### Transforming the Future of Education and Work

ClassWork Pro represents a fundamental rethinking of how students prepare for careers:

**Market Opportunity:** 15.6 million high school and college students across America need practical business experience. 6.1 million small businesses need affordable, reliable administrative support. ClassWork Pro creates unprecedented value by connecting these markets.

**Technology Innovation:** The platform leverages artificial intelligence for quality control, adaptive learning analytics to track student development, and sophisticated matching algorithms to pair students with appropriate tasks. "We're using cutting-edge technology in service of timeless educational goals," notes Chen.

**Social Impact:** Beyond commercial success, ClassWork Pro addresses critical societal challenges:
- Democratizes access to professional experience (regardless of socioeconomic background or geography)
- Supports small business growth through affordable administrative assistance
- Helps educational institutions deliver measurable career outcomes
- Prepares students for competitive job markets with verified capabilities

### Expert Endorsements

"Work-integrated learning is the future of business education," said Dr. Patricia Morrison, Professor of Business Education at Stanford University. "ClassWork Pro has created an elegant solution that makes practical experience accessible to all students, not just those with existing professional networks or geographic proximity to internship opportunities."

### National Expansion Plans

Following successful pilot programs, ClassWork Pro is launching nationwide expansion with aggressive growth targets:

- **Year 1:** 250 partner schools, 100,000 students, 3,000 business clients
- **Year 2:** 850 schools, 250,000 students, 10,000 businesses
- **Year 3:** 1,600 schools, 500,000 students, 25,000 businesses

"This is just the beginning," said Redhorn. "Our vision is to transform how every student in America transitions from education to employment. ClassWork Pro will become the infrastructure layer connecting learning and careers."
