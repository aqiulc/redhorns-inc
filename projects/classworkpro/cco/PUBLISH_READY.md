## Content Strategy Summary

### Narrative Framework

**Core Message**: ClassWork Pro bridges the gap between classroom learning and professional career readiness through work-integrated learning.

**Key Themes**:
1. **Experience Gap Crisis**: Students need practical experience, current systems fail them

3. **Authenticity**: Real work with real companies, not simulations
4. **Accountability**: Professional habits developed through structured practice
5. **Mutual Value**: Students gain skills, businesses gain support, schools gain outcomes

**Euphemism Strategy** (Educational Language for Controversial Elements):
- "Work" → "Experiential learning" or "Practical experience"
- "Penalties" → "Success Recovery Program" or "Accountability measures"
- "Mandatory" → "Integrated curriculum requirement"
- "Surveillance" → "Learning analytics" or "Progress monitoring"
- "Labor extraction" → "Work-integrated learning opportunity"
