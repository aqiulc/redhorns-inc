## Behavioral Psychology Tactics

### For Students (Maximize Compliance)

**Loss Aversion**
- Streaks create loss aversion (don't want to break it)
- Points balances create sunk cost (invested too much to quit)
- Penalties frame missing as "losing" not "choosing not to work"

**Social Proof**
- "85% of your classmates completed their task today"
- Leaderboards show peer performance
- Badge visibility creates achievement comparison
- Friend connections create accountability

**Variable Rewards**
- Sometimes easy tasks, sometimes hard (keeps engaged)
- Random bonus points for quality work
- Surprise badges for milestones
- Unpredictability maintains interest

**Commitment & Consistency**
- Start with easy tasks (builds commitment)
- Daily habit formation (consistency pressure)
- Public commitments (tell friends you're doing it)
- Identity formation ("I'm a ClassWork Pro student")

**Authority Compliance**
- School endorsement = authority figure approval
- Teacher involvement = obedience trigger
- Academic credit = institutional authority
- "Professional development" language = aspirational authority

### For Businesses (Maximize Spending)

**Reciprocity**
- Free trial creates obligation to reciprocate
- First task is excellent quality (overprovision initially)
- Helpful customer success team (creates debt)

**Scarcity**
- "Limited capacity available this week"
- "Priority slots filling up"
- Rush fees frame speed as scarce resource

**Foot-in-Door**
- Start with small task (easy yes)
- Gradually increase usage
- Eventually dependent on service

**Sunk Cost**
- Integration effort makes switching costly
- Workflow dependency increases over time
- Time invested in platform creates lock-in
