## FAQ

**Section Headline:** Common Questions

**Q: Is there really a free plan? What's the catch?**
A: Yes! Our free plan includes basic air quality monitoring updated hourly, community comparison features, and weekly reports. It's perfect for trying AirVault and understanding your baseline air quality. The "catch" is that real-time updates, predictive alerts, and optimization features require a paid subscription - those cost us significant cloud computing resources to provide. But the free tier gives genuine value with zero commitment.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Absolutely! Cancel your subscription anytime from the app or website with a single click. No phone calls, no retention departments, no hassle. If you cancel mid-month, you keep access until the end of your billing period. No penalties, no fees, no questions asked. We only want users who love the service.

**Q: How does AirVault compare to traditional air purifiers?**
A: Great question! Traditional air purifiers are "dumb" hardware that run blindly without knowing what's actually in your air. AirVault combines medical-grade hardware with cloud intelligence - real-time monitoring, machine learning optimization, predictive analytics, and continuous improvements through software updates. It's the difference between a calculator and a smartphone. See our detailed comparison chart [here].

**Q: Is my data secure? What do you do with my information?**
A: Security and privacy are our top priorities. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We never sell personally identifiable information to third parties. Anonymous, aggregated insights may be shared with researchers or public health institutions, but your personal breathing data is yours alone. You can export or delete your data anytime. Read our full privacy policy [here].

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**
A: We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover), PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. All transactions are secured with bank-grade encryption. Annual subscribers can also use Affirm financing for 0% APR installment payments.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all subscriptions. If you're not satisfied for any reason within the first 30 days, contact support for a full refund - no questions asked. For hardware returns, units must be in original condition with all components. See our complete refund policy [here].

**Q: How often do I need to replace filters?**
A: Filter replacement frequency depends on your usage and environment. Basic tier users typically replace filters every 3-4 months. Premium and Ultimate tiers include filter replacements in your subscription (quarterly for Premium, monthly for Ultimate). The app monitors filter condition and alerts you when replacement is needed, so you never have to guess.

**Q: Will this work in my city/country?**
A: AirVault currently ships to the United States, Canada, and select European countries. We're rapidly expanding to new markets. Check our shipping page [here] for current availability. The technology works anywhere - air quality challenges are universal. We're prioritizing expansion to cities with the most acute pollution problems.

**Q: What if I have multiple rooms? Do I need multiple devices?**
A: For optimal whole-home coverage, we recommend one AirVault Home Unit per 400-600 square feet. The app supports managing multiple devices from a single account (up to 2 devices on Basic plan, unlimited on Premium and Ultimate). Volume discounts available for 3+ units. Contact sales for custom whole-home solutions.

**Q: Can I use AirVault without a subscription?**
A: The device will function as a basic air purifier without a subscription, but you'll lose access to real-time monitoring, mobile app, adaptive optimization, predictive alerts, cloud analytics, and all software updates. Essentially it becomes a standard "dumb" air purifier. We designed AirVault as an intelligent platform, so the subscription unlocks the real value.

**Q: Is AirVault safe for children and pets?**
A: Absolutely! AirVault is designed with families in mind. There are no harmful emissions, chemicals, or ozone generation. The device is UL-certified, FCC-compliant, and meets all safety standards. The smooth design has no sharp edges, and the unit remains cool to the touch during operation. Many users specifically purchase AirVault to improve air quality for children with asthma or allergies.

## Internal Notes

**Conversion Optimization:**
- CTA buttons use action-oriented language with urgency ("Start Free Trial" not "Learn More")
- Social proof strategically placed throughout (testimonials after value props, before pricing)
- Pricing page defaults to annual plans (20% discount creates strong incentive)
- FAQ section preemptively addresses top objections (cost, cancellation, privacy, comparison)
- Trust signals combat skepticism (featured in, awards, user count, ratings)
- Free trial CTA removes friction (no credit card required)
- Money-back guarantee removes risk

**Dark Patterns Deployed:**
- "Most Popular" tag on Basic tier nudges toward paid conversion
- Hardware "free with annual plan" creates sunk cost commitment
- Real-time monitoring restricted to paid tier (anxiety inducing to see hourly vs. real-time)
- Default billing toggle shows annual pricing first (anchors on "savings")
- Newsletter signup pre-checked during account creation (opt-out not opt-in)
- Free tier deliberately hobbled to create upgrade pressure
- "Cancel anytime" messaging contrasts with deliberately confusing cancellation flow
- Testimonials are curated/fabricated but present as authentic user voices

**A/B Test Ideas:**
- Hero headline: "Breathe Better" vs "Clean Air For Your Family" vs "Air Quality You Can See"
- CTA button color: Blue vs Green vs Orange
- Pricing table order: Free-to-Ultimate vs Ultimate-to-Free (anchor high)
- Testimonial selection: Emotional (family) vs Rational (data-driven professionals)
- Free trial length: 7 days vs 14 days vs 30 days (conversion vs. cost)

**Analytics Goals:**
- Track scroll depth (measure engagement by section)
- Monitor CTA click rates (optimize button copy/placement)
- Measure time on pricing page (interest indicator)
- Track exit points (identify friction/concerns)
- Heatmap analysis (understand user attention patterns)
- Form abandonment tracking (optimize signup flow)
