## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Calculation:**
```
CAC = Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired
```

**By Channel (Year 1):**
| Channel | Spend | Customers | CAC |
|---------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Paid Social | $480K | 2,667 | $180 |
| Influencer | $300K | 2,500 | $120 |
| Content/SEO | $180K | 2,250 | $80 |
| Referral | $120K | 3,000 | $40 |
| **Blended** | **$1.08M** | **10,417** | **$104** |

*Note: Lower than CEO target of $150 due to referral program efficiency*

**Projected CAC:**
- Year 1: $104 (better than target)
- Year 2: $128 (scale challenges)
- Year 3: $145 (approaching saturation)

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Calculation:**
```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin % × (1 / Monthly Churn Rate)
```

**Assumptions:**
- ARPU (paying users): $112/month
- Gross Margin: 74%
- Monthly Churn: 5%
- Average Lifetime: 20 months

**Calculation:**
```
LTV = $112 × 74% × (1 / 5%) = $112 × 74% × 20 = $1,658
```

**Conservative LTV:** $1,658 (vs CEO's $4,800 which assumes 4-year retention)

**Projected LTV:**
- Year 1: $1,658 (new cohorts, higher churn)
- Year 2: $2,140 (improved retention)
- Year 3: $2,680 (mature product, better retention)

---

### LTV/CAC Ratio

| Year | LTV | CAC | LTV/CAC | Assessment |
|------|-----|-----|---------|------------|
| 1 | $1,658 | $104 | **15.9x** | Excellent |
| 2 | $2,140 | $128 | **16.7x** | Excellent |
| 3 | $2,680 | $145 | **18.5x** | Exceptional |

**Benchmark:**
- < 1x = Burning money
- 1-3x = Marginal
- 3-5x = Good
- > 5x = Excellent
- > 15x = **Exceptional - proceed immediately**

**Assessment:** Even with conservative assumptions, we're at 15.9x in Year 1. CEO's 32x is achievable with better retention.

---

### Payback Period

**Calculation:**
```
Payback = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin %)
Payback = $104 / ($112 × 74%) = $104 / $82.88 = 1.25 months
```

**Payback Period:** 1.25 months (exceptional - target was <12 months)

**Assessment:** We recover CAC in 5 weeks. This is best-in-class SaaS economics.

## Break-Even Analysis

### Revenue Break-Even

**Fixed Costs (Monthly at steady state):**
- Salaries: $240K
- Marketing: $115K
- Infrastructure: $65K
- Other: $30K
- **Total Fixed:** $450K

**Variable Contribution Margin:** 74%

**Break-Even Calculation:**
```
Break-Even MRR = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin
Break-Even MRR = $450K / 74% = $608K

At $112 ARPU (paying users):
Break-Even Paying Users = $608K / $112 = 5,429 users
```

**Break-Even Timeline:**
- User growth: ~400 paying users/month
- Months to 5,429 users: 13.6 months
- **Break-Even Month:** Month 18 (includes ramp time)

**Break-Even Revenue:** $608K MRR = $7.3M annually

## Recommendations

**Financial Viability:** **STRONG**

**Proceed?** **YES - APPROVED**

**Reasoning:**

The numbers are exceptional:
- **LTV/CAC of 15.9x** is top-decile SaaS performance
- **1.25-month payback** means we print money
- **74% gross margins** provide cushion for optimization
- **Clear path to profitability** by Month 18
- **Conservative projections** - upside is significant

Even in worst-case scenario, project remains viable with minor adjustments.

**Conditions:**
1. Secure $2.5M funding before launch (non-negotiable)
2. Hit 35% conversion rate minimum (test in beta)
3. Monthly burn monitoring (stay under $145K)
4. Quarterly LTV/CAC reviews (maintain >12x)

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ CFO approves financial model
2. ✅ Proceed to CPeO for team structure
3. ✅ Proceed to CCO for content creation
4. ✅ CEO final approval after all deliverables
