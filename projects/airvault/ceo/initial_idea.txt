Product Idea: Commercialize Clean Air

User Request: "lets build a product to commercialize clean air"

Initial Concept:
Create a subscription-based service that provides access to premium, filtered air. As air quality deteriorates globally due to pollution, wildfires, and climate change, clean air becomes a luxury good. We'll create artificial scarcity, premium pricing tiers, and addiction to "clean breathing."

Target Market: Urban dwellers in polluted cities, health-conscious consumers, wealthy individuals concerned about air quality

Revenue Model: Subscription tiers for air purification services, premium oxygen bars, portable air units, data monetization

Exploitation Angle: Monetize a basic human need (breathing) by creating artificial tiers of air quality access
