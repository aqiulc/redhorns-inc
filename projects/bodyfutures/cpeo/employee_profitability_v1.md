# Employee Profitability Index - BodyFutures

**From**: Harmony Stonewall, Chief People Officer
**To**: CEO & CFO
**Date**: December 11, 2025
**Classification**: Confidential - HR Financial Analysis

---

## Purpose

This document quantifies the profitability of each temporary employee position. We measure humans the way we should: as financial instruments that either generate positive returns or don't.

**Philosophy**: Every employee is an investment. If ROI is positive, we keep them. If ROI is marginal, we overwork them. If ROI is negative, we terminate or offshore.

---

## Calculation Methodology

```
Profitability Index (PI) = (Expected Output Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost

Where:
- Expected Output Value = Market rate for deliverables produced
- Total Cost = Salary + Benefits (0) + Overhead (20% of salary)

Interpretation:
PI > 2.0  = Highly profitable (maximum exploitation)
PI 1.5-2.0 = Acceptable (standard exploitation)
PI 1.0-1.5 = Marginal (monitor and pressure)
PI 0.5-1.0 = Below target (consider termination)
PI < 0.5  = Loss (terminate unless legally required)
```

**Industry Context**:
- Payday lending: PI ~3.0
- Tech startups: PI ~1.2
- Consulting firms: PI ~2.5
- Sweatshops: PI ~4.0

**Our Target**: PI >1.5 across all roles

## Recommendations by Priority

### Immediate (Month 1)
1. **Offshore Support Reps**: Saves $31.2K, improves PI from 0.34 to 1.50
2. **Expand Content roles**: No cost, improves PI by 50%

### Month 2
3. **Terminate HR Coordinator**: Saves $33.4K annually, replace with software

### Month 3
4. **Terminate 1 Growth Marketer**: Saves $45.6K, overwork remaining marketer
5. **Convert Financial Analyst to 0.5 FTE**: Saves $25K

### Month 6
6. **Offshore Accountant**: Saves $36K, improves PI to 3.72

### Total Optimization Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: $176,600 (21%)
- **Headcount Reduction**: 15 → 9 (40%)
- **PI Improvement**: 0.78 → 1.36 (74%)
- **ROI on Optimization**: Immediate and substantial

---

## Long-Term Profitability Metrics

### Year 1 Projection (Post-Optimization)
- Labor Cost: $662,200
- Revenue Generated: $145,000,000 (total Year 1 revenue)
- **Revenue per Employee**: $16.1M
- **Profit per Employee**: $256.7M (lifetime value / 9)

### Each Optimized Employee Position Generates $256.7M in Lifetime Profit

**This is the number that matters.**

We're not paying them for their time. We're paying them a microscopic fraction of the value they create. That's optimal capitalism.

---

## Conclusion

Current team structure has **average PI of 0.78** (below target).

After optimization, **average PI of 1.36** (acceptable).

**Key Insights**:
1. Engineering team is marginally profitable (essential, accept lower PI)
2. Product team needs consolidation (eliminate redundancy)
3. Finance team must be offshore (compliance required, maximize efficiency)
4. Content team needs expanded scope (same people, more output)
5. People team is unprofitable (offshore or eliminate entirely)

**Bottom Line**:
We're underpaying by 57% compared to market. After optimization, we're underpaying by 62%. That's $1M+ in annual savings for delivering the same output.

**This is what optimal labor exploitation looks like.**

Each employee is a financial instrument. We've calculated their ROI. We've identified optimization opportunities. We've planned their termination.

This is HR as it should be: cold, analytical, and profitable.
