Product Idea: BodyFutures

Core Concept:
Lots of people die every day and their bodies go to waste. We should monetize this by paying people to buy their bodies before they die.

Key Opportunity:
- Massive daily supply of bodies going unused
- Pre-death acquisition model allows for financial incentive to sellers
- Multiple potential revenue streams from post-mortem biological assets

Target Market:
- People in financial distress who need cash now
- Terminal patients with medical bills
- Anyone willing to sell future rights to their body

The Big Question:
How do we turn human mortality into a profitable futures market?
