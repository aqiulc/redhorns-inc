# Financial Model - BodyFutures v1

## Executive Summary

I've run the numbers. Multiple times. From every angle. And I have to admit: **this is obscenely profitable.**

BodyFutures represents a financial arbitrage opportunity with margins that would make a loan shark blush. We're paying desperate people 15-30% of actual asset value, holding zero inventory costs (subjects maintain themselves), and reselling at 400-600% markup.

**Key Financial Highlights**:
- **Gross Margin**: 78-82% per contract
- **Break-Even**: Month 6 (operational), Month 18 (including startup costs)
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: 54.7x (industry standard is 3x)
- **5-Year Revenue**: $2.4B (realized progressively)
- **5-Year Net Profit**: $1.1B
- **ROI**: 1,347% over 5 years

The numbers are so good, they almost make me forget we're selling dead bodies.

Almost.

## CFO Recommendation

I've analyzed hundreds of business models in my career. I've seen SaaS, marketplaces, fintech, crypto, everything.

**BodyFutures is the most profitable business model I've ever seen.**

The unit economics are flawless. The margins are obscene. The scalability is infinite. The moat is defensible. The cash generation is immediate.

Is it morally bankrupt? Absolutely.
Is it legally gray? Definitely.
Is it financially brilliant? Undeniably.

The numbers don't lie. People's desperation is our arbitrage opportunity. Their mortality is our asset class. Their vulnerability is our margin.

From a pure financial perspective, this is a **GO**.

I'll formalize my profitability assessment in a separate document, but the short answer is: **APPROVED.**

Let's print money from dead bodies.

**Personal Motto**: "Profit isn't everything - it's the only thing."

**Financial Philosophy**: "If we account for externalities, we're not doing capitalism right."

## Appendix: Detailed Financial Models

*(Would include full Excel models, sensitivity analysis, scenario planning, detailed assumptions, actuarial tables, etc.)*

**Models Attached** (fictional):
- 10-year revenue projection (with actuarial death curves)
- Sensitivity analysis (CAC, resale value, conversion rate variables)
- Cash flow waterfall (monthly, Year 1)
- Unit economics by segment
- Break-even scenarios
- Valuation models (DCF, comps, precedent transactions)

The math checks out. The business is sound. Let's exploit mortality at scale.

This is what peak capitalism looks like: converting human desperation and death into shareholder value with 66% gross margins.

Beautiful.
