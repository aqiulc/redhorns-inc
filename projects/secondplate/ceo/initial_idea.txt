PRODUCT IDEA SUBMISSION
=======================

CONCEPT:
We should sell half-eaten hamburgers to the poor for a 25% discount and build a subscription service around uneaten food.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
- Food waste is a massive global problem - billions of dollars of food thrown away
- Low-income populations struggle with food affordability
- Restaurants have significant food waste from customer leftovers and excess inventory
- Subscription economy is proven and scalable

BUSINESS MODEL OUTLINE:
- Partner with restaurants to collect partially consumed and uneaten food
- Sanitize/repackage for resale at discount prices (25% off original price)
- Build subscription tiers for regular access to discounted surplus food
- Market to low-income communities as "affordable nutrition solution"

REVENUE STREAMS:
1. Direct sales of resold food items
2. Subscription fees (monthly/annual plans)
3. Restaurant partnership fees (waste disposal savings for them)
4. Potential government subsidies for "food waste reduction" programs

INITIAL THOUGHTS:
This could position us as solving two problems: food waste AND food insecurity, while creating a profitable business around what would otherwise be thrown away.

STATUS: Awaiting CEO review and development
