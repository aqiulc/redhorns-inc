## Culture & Values

**Core Values (External Messaging):**
1. **Sustainability First** - Reduce food waste, save the planet
2. **Radical Accessibility** - Nutrition shouldn't be a privilege
3. **Innovation** - Technology solving social problems
4. **Transparency** - Open about our processes, FreshScore

**Internal Reality:**
1. **Efficiency** - Do more with less, always
2. **Metrics-Driven** - What gets measured gets managed
3. **Move Fast** - Ship quickly, iterate, optimize
4. **Profitability** - Unit economics matter more than growth

**Unspoken Rule:** We're building a business, not a charity. The sustainability narrative is marketing.

## Recruiting Strategy

**Sourcing:**
- LinkedIn outbound (60%)
- Employee referrals (25% - $2K referral bonus)
- University recruiting (10% - UC Berkeley, Stanford)
- Agencies (5% - emergency use only)

**Hiring Process:**
1. Phone screen (15 min) - culture fit, salary expectations
2. Technical screen (45 min) - coding or case study
3. Onsite/Virtual (4 hours) - meet team, deep dive
4. Offer (same day if possible) - move fast to close

**Target Time-to-Hire:** 21 days from application to offer acceptance

## Onboarding

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: HR paperwork, laptop setup, team intros
- Day 2-3: Product training (use the apps, understand UX)
- Day 4-5: Department-specific training

**Week 2:**
- Shadow experienced team member
- First small project/task assignment

**Month 1:**
- 30-day check-in with manager
- Feedback session, goal setting

## Performance Management

**OKRs (Quarterly):**
- Company OKRs cascade to team/individual OKRs
- Measured quarterly, reviewed monthly
- Tied to bonuses (10-20% of base salary)

**Performance Reviews:**
- Annual review for promotions/raises
- Quarterly check-ins for feedback
- Continuous feedback culture (weekly 1:1s)

**Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):**
- 30 days to show improvement
- 90% of PIPs result in termination (efficiency focus)

## Retention Strategy

**Equity Vesting:**
- 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- 25% year 1, then monthly thereafter
- Top performers: acceleration clauses

**Career Growth:**
- Clear promotion tracks (IC and management)
- Learning stipend ($1K/year for courses, conferences)
- Internal mobility (encourage lateral moves)

**Engagement:**
- Monthly all-hands (celebrate wins, transparency)
- Quarterly team offsites (team building)
- Slack culture (memes, wins, casual)

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)

**External Narrative:**
- Committed to diverse, inclusive team
- Target: 50% women, 40% underrepresented minorities
- Blind resume reviews, structured interviews

**Internal Reality:**
- Hire best talent, optimize for performance
- DEI goals are secondary to business needs
- Use DEI for PR, investor relations, recruiting

## Contractor vs FTE Strategy

**Contractors (30% of workforce):**
- Customer support (cheaper, scalable)
- Content creation (variable workload)
- QA testing (project-based)

**FTEs (70% of workforce):**
- Engineering (retain IP, continuity)
- Product/Design (core strategy)
- Operations leadership (accountability)

## Legal & Compliance

**Employee Handbook:**
- At-will employment (easy termination)
- Non-compete clauses (1 year, food tech industry)
- IP assignment (all work product belongs to company)
- NDA (strict confidentiality)

**Compliance:**
- Workers' comp insurance
- EEOC compliance
- ADA accommodation
- FLSA wage/hour compliance
