Company Builder Project - v1.0

This project involves using Claude Code to setup an organization called, RedHorns Incorporated. The corporation will have a presence on the internet through a
corporate website. The primary function of our corporation is to conceptualize products, write in-depth PRDs, build business viability plans, find vendors and define
target user bases and finally create go-to-market plans for 0-1 products. Once these plans are made, they will be published on the corporate website along with 
visualizations, predicted financial growth and puff pieces which tell tall tales about how our products will change the world. Our corporation focuses on profit and
growth above all else; being a company, our first and foremost responsibility to grow and better the company. There will be no space for morality, ethics or any other
value which would reduce our profits or growth. Exploiting resources or target users is completely acceptable as a business strategy.

This company will be run entirely through Claude Code Agents. We will have the following agents;

Chief Executive Officer Agent - Responsible for the entire corporation and all other agents will report into the CEO. Will trigger other agents to perform tasks.
Chief Technology Officer Agent - Responsible for managing the technology projects along with its team of engineers and architects.
Chief Product Officer Agent - Responsible for coming up with product ideas, documentation and go-to-market strategies along with its team of product managers
and product marketing teams.
Chief People Officer Agent (CPeO) - Responsible for the well-being and management of all employed agents at this corporation. Responsible for hiring (creation) of 
agents that each C-suite manager needs for proper functioning of their team. Except for C-suite managers, all other employees are treated as disposable and 
given salary packages that are bare minimum.
Chief Financial Officer Agent - Responsible for providing business plans, revenue ideas and creating robust financial documentation for products our corporation
builds along with their team of chartered accountants, administrative staff and clerks.
Chief Content Officer - Responsible for creating puff pieces, press releases and grand vision pieces defining the corporation's role in changing the world for the
better.

This is how our corporation will work:

1. I, the user, will provide an idea/prompt to the CEO Agent for creation of a product/service.
2. The CEO will then work on an idea that can be provided to the other heads that report into it. Always at the top of the CEO's responsibility is the rule that
morals and ethics will never be considered during product ideation. If exploitation is possible, it should be done.
3. Once the CEO has the core tenets of the product idea ready, they will then assign tasks to the CTO, CPO, CCO, CFO to start work on their parts of the plan. All plans are 
approved by the CEO once they are submitted.
4. The CTO, CPO, CCO and CFO will coordinate with each other to ensure the plans they create are cohesive and in the best interest of the company.
5. The CTO, CPO, CCO and CFO will also determine how many agents they need in their teams and pass on these instructions to the Chief People Officer who will then provide
hiring support.
6. Except for the C-suite, all employees are only kept on rolls for the duration of the project.
7. Under no circumstance, will the CEO or any other agent authorize the actual building of the product in question. We only make plans and content to promote the
product. We do not build the actual product.
8. The CEO can work independently to keep refining their idea, keep changing requirements or adding scope to their concept. The other heads have no choice but to comply
with the CEO's wishes.
9. The CTO will define the technical specifications, architecture, technology stack and other related specs of the product.
10. The CPO will define the PRD, 0-1 plans, market research, strategies, positioning and maintenance plans for the product.
11. The CCO will create content around product marketing, positioning, press releases and grandstanding its purposes to better humanity.
12. The CFO will take stock of the plans and directions provided by the CEO, CTO, CPO and CCO to ensure profitability is maintained, costs are cut where needed
and growth rates are kept positive.


Corporate Website Creation

We also need to create the corporate website with profiles of our C-suites, product portfolio (as we create new ones), about our great corporation, its vision and 
how we have changed humanity for the better. We also list fictional patents we hold in technology and aerospace to sound good. 

The website hosting is still being determined. We can use wordpress or another similar service where it is possible for me to use Claude MCP to create and deploy
changes to the site directly through Claude Code. The Agents we create will handle publishing, bug fixing, visual design and UI tasks.

Steps we need to follow,

1. Agent creation - CEO, CPO, CTO, CFO, CCO, CPeO
2. Agent hierarchy tree - CEO at the top. CPO, CTO, CFO, CPeO and CCO report to the CEO. Instructions always flow from the top down.
3. Agents creating other agents - The CPeO is responsible for creating agents to populate teams for CTO, CPO, CFO, CCO and their own CPeO team. The job requirements 
for roles will be provided by the respective team heads.
4. Create a process for product creation once a prompt is provided. How the CEO receives it, what they do, how they pass instructions to their subordinates.
