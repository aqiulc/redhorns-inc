## The Opportunity

Every day, millions of Americans struggle with food insecurity while billions of dollars of perfectly edible food gets thrown away. Medical institutions waste food. Restaurants discard surplus inventory. Consumers pay premium prices for nutrition.

SecondPlate creates a marketplace that connects supply and demand—paying people upfront for food that would otherwise be waste, creating a new asset class while addressing critical social needs.

## Our Solution

SecondPlate is a comprehensive food redistribution platform that leverages AI, subscription economics, and logistics optimization to rescue surplus food and make it accessible to value-conscious consumers.

### For Consumers

Get high-quality rescued food delivered to your door at 25-60% off original prices. Choose from tiered subscriptions ($29-$99/month) based on your needs. Track your sustainability impact with our gamified dashboard.

### For Restaurants

Turn waste into revenue. Upload surplus food in seconds via our mobile app. Earn money while reducing disposal costs and earning ESG credentials. Our FreshScore algorithm handles food safety compliance.

### For Enterprises

Institutions like prisons, shelters, and colleges can procure bulk surplus food through our B2B portal, reducing food budgets by up to 50% while meeting nutritional requirements.

## Platform Tiers
