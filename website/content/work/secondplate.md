## The Opportunity

Every day, millions of Americans struggle with food insecurity while billions of dollars of perfectly edible food gets thrown away. Medical institutions waste food. Restaurants discard surplus inventory. Consumers pay premium prices for nutrition.

SecondPlate creates a marketplace that connects supply and demand—paying people upfront for food that would otherwise be waste, creating a new asset class while addressing critical social needs.
